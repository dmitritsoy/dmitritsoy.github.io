Hi! I'm Dmitri Tsoy. 
<br><br>An experienced and passionate software engineer, team lead and consultant. 
<br><br>I'm very familiar with .NET (up to dotnetcore 3.1), modern client-side frameworks and both SQL and No-SQL databases. I've built a bunch of websites running in the cloud, participated in product development at startups and <a href="#experience">worked for some of the biggest companies in the Netherlands</a>. 
<br>
<br>Since 2014 I have been a <a href="#certifications">certified scrum master</a> and helped in setting up, running and improving multiple scrum teams.

<br>I do strongly believe in the majority of the funny sounding software related abbreviations such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID" target="_blank">SOLID</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself" target="_blank">DRY</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle" target="_blank">KISS</a> as well as in <a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/" target="_blank">the Agile Manifesto</a>.

<br>I am always open to meeting new people and exploring possibilities so do not hesitate to contact me through one of <a href="#social">the social networks</a>.
